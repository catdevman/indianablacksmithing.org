<p><b>By-Laws.</b> The Indiana Blacksmithing Association, Inc., is a
volunteer-run organization. The Association is a Not-For-Profit
Indiana Corporation formed in 1980 with the purpose of gathering and
disseminating information about the craft of blacksmithing. It also
seeks to make the public more aware of this ancient craft and the
changes which are occurring in blacksmithing today. Here is a copy of
our <a href="IBABylaws.pdf">bylaws</a> as well as the <a
href="SatelliteGroupGuidelines.pdf">guidelines for Local Groups
Operating under the Umbrella of the Indiana Blacksmithing Association,
INC</a>.

<p><b>Membership</b> in the Indiana Blacksmithing Association, Inc. is open
to all persons. We welcome you! Membership dues are paid at the time
of application and are renewed in June. Dues are $ 35.00 for an
individual or for a family (usually a spouse). If you would like an
application form mailed to you or have any other questions, please
contact <a href="board.html">Rob Hough</a>. Alternatively, download
the <a href="MEMBRO-IN2023.pdf">Membership Application</a>,
fill it in and mail it to <a href="board.html">Rob Hough</a>.

<p><b>Newsletter:</b> The Association publishes a monthly newsletter
"The Forge Fire" with information of interest to blacksmiths and metal
workers. As a member you are welcome and encouraged to submit articles
for publication, ads for blacksmith related materials you have for
sale or want to buy, and inquiries for needed information. Material to
be published may be sent in typed form. It may also be sent in long
hand and it will be typed for you. Please be sure to include your
name, address, and phone number so that we may contact you if we have
a question. Depending on the need to publish other material, your
material may not be included in the next issue. We reserve the right
to edit material. To promote the IBA and in keeping with our mission
to educate about blacksmithing, the board recently voted to make
available newsletters two months or older to the general public. See
them <a href="newsletters">here</a> and feel free to tell a friend. We
hope that this way, even more folks get interested in the IBA and
decide to join our wonderful organization. If you like the
newsletters, please consider becoming a member to support the work we
do. We welcome you!

<p><b>Scholarships.</b> The IBA makes available scholarships to its
members in the amount of up to 350 dollars. They support the
furthering of blacksmithing skills and knowledge. To apply, get in
touch with with Education Chairman of the <a
href="board.html">board</a>. In return for receiving a scholarship,
you are asked to write an article for our newsletter and to give a
demonstration at one of our hammer-ins.

<p><b>Hammer-Ins.</b> The Association holds meetings each month at various locations
around the state. Information about these meetings is included in the
newsletter preceding each meeting. You are urged to attend, ask
questions, and participate. Getting to know the various smiths around
the state and their various skills can be of considerable help to you
when you have questions about materials, processes, and tools. Guests
are always welcome! 

<p><b>Library</b>. To assist you in broadening your knowledge, the
Association operates a lending library. A listing of the books,
materials, and VHS videotapes in the library is updated each March for
the Annual Business Meeting. Materials added during the year are
mentioned in The Forge Fire. You are encouraged to use the library and
to contribute blacksmith/metalsmith related items. The Librarian and
library are available at many meetings and materials can be sent to
you if necessary. The Librarian can provide further information and
explain our loan policy. To make it easier for you to check out
materials from our library, here is the <a
href="LibraryLoan.pdf">form</a> that you need to send to our
librarian. The board recently voted to eliminate the loan deposit.

<p><b>Annual Conference.</b> The Association holds a conference the
first weekend in June to which skilled demonstrators are invited. In
this way we all hope to broaden our knowledge. Information about this
conference is carried in The Forge Fire and the conference
brochure. To cover the cost of this conference, a separate fee is
charged. We urge you to attend and support the conference.

<p><b>ABANA.</b> The IBA is one of some fifty affiliates of
the <a href="http://www.abana.org">Artist-Blacksmiths' Association of
North America, Inc.</a> (ABANA). ABANA has nearly 4000 members in
North America and many foreign countries. You will benefit from
membership in ABANA, it's publications, and biennial conferences. 

<p><b>Store.</b> The Association operates a store to make IBA items
such as pins, hats, and t-shirts available. It also carries
hard-to-locate safety items, which are wanted by our members. The
store is available most meetings.
