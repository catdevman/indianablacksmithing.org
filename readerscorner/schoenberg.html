<h3 align="center">3rd Smithing Meeting in Schoenberg, Germany</h3>

Below are some photographs of a smithing meeting held in Schoenberg,
Germany.

<p>This meeting was held in the town square and as you can tell, it is
held rain or shine. The town square is a very busy area, especially in
a small town. Several busy stores as well as the visitor's center line
the "square." Furthermore, the town square is regularly used by other
ordanizations and a market is held once a week. As such, the market
place is a common and frequent meeting space.

<p>There are several benefits of holding a smithing meeting in a central
space:

<ol>
<li>We go to the public, instead of asking the public to come to
us. This has two benefits: recruitment and customers. 

<li>By holding it in a public (market) place the message being sent is
that blacksmithing is a relevant craft, not something relegated to the
history books.
