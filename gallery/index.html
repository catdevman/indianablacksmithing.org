On these pages, we celebrate the work and artistry of blacksmiths. If
you are a blacksmith, hopefully the work displayed here will inspire
you. If you have a cursory interest in blacksmithing, these pages will
give you a sense of the breath and beauty of work done by
blacksmiths. Perhaps, you want to add some blacksmith work to your
home. You may be surprised at the reasonable prices at which you can
purchase such work. A good place to do so is the annual IBA
conference, held during the first weekend in June in Tipton, IN. Next
time, you see a smith demonstrate, just talk to him or her and see
what some wheeling and dealing will get you.

<p> <b>Call for contributions.</b> If you have pictures of your own
work or that of others, please email them to me. If you would like to
say a few things about the images, that would be even better, but is
not necessary. See the email address below.

guard forged from low carbon steel.
